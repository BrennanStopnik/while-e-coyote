/*
Write a program, `fibonacci.js` that accepts a number, `n`, from the user and consequently logs the first `n` values in the fibonacci sequence.

The fibonacci sequence starts with 0 then 1. Each subsequent value can be obtained by summing the previous two values:
```
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 ...
```
Example
```
Enter a value for "n":
> 9

0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
```

// Need 2 Variable to keep track of each of the 2 number that are going to get added.
